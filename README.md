<p align="center">A personal Project that consists of a restaurant website.</p>
<p align="center">A tribute to my kitten called ‚ÄúCanela‚Äù :cat:, in which I‚Äôve developed this code that it‚Äôs basically a restaurant webpage.</p>


### :computer: Tecnologies
As main programming language I‚Äôve used JavaScript with JSX, HTML and CSS. Also I‚Äôve used the React library.


### :dizzy: Dependencies
I've added two funny dependencies, I will talk about the use of them shortly:
I've used the "react-google-maps" in the "About us" page, allowing to put the address of the restaurant in the form of a map. 
In the reservation form, the dependency "Formik" was used, so, with the use of conditional operators, I've managed to generate requirements in a way that the user will be able to fill the form with all the data that should be filled for complete the reservation. Firstly, if there is some empty field, an error message will be shown, indicating that all fields must be filled. In the telephone field adding a number with more than 13 digits it's not allowed, and the application will prompt a error message that says "Telefone inv√°lido"; In the "Type Number", in which the user says how many seats will be necessary, the maximum amount of seats is 10, if the user surpasses this number of seats, an error message will be shown saying "Limite de 10 pessoas por mesa".

Wow... I've fulfilled everything right, what happens now? Clicking the "Confirmar" button, the following message will be shown: "Em breve entraremos em contato, para confirmar sua reserva! Agradecemos √† prefer√™ncia!"


### :art: CSS
I've used the "styled-components" component, that is a library in which the writing of code is made by combination of JavaScript and CSS. it was of great help to style the website pages.
